### Run

Run `ng serve` to build on the fly App wrapper (source path: `src/app`)
  + optional flag: `--live-reload=false`

3. Navigate to App root folder, path: `/`
4. Link `tc-gallery` library using the globally linked package: `npm link tc-gallery`
5. In test App, import and use the components from library as needed.
